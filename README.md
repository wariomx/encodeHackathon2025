## üìú Overview

Softlaw is a decentralized legal automation protocol that bridges traditional legal frameworks with blockchain technology. Initially developed during a hackathon, this project is now evolving as part of a Web3 Foundation grant. The protocol enables the creation, management, and enforcement of digital legal licenses through smart contracts with DAO-based governance.

## üîë Key Features

- **Digital Legal Licensing**: Create and manage legal licenses on-chain
- **DAO Governance**: Decentralized decision-making for protocol updates and license management
- **Modular Treasury**: Flexible financial operations for the protocol ecosystem
- **ERC-20 Utility Token**: Native token for governance and protocol functionality

## üì¶ Smart Contract Architecture

The protocol consists of the following core smart contracts:

| Contract               | Description                                                                                                    |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Governor.sol**       | Core DAO contract that manages proposals, calls, and memberships. Integrates with LicenseManager and Treasury. |
| **LicenseManager.sol** | Handles creation, validation, and revocation of legal licenses across the protocol.                            |
| **License.sol**        | Defines structure, permissions, and lifecycle for individual legal licenses.                                   |
| **Treasury.sol**       | Manages the DAO's financial operations, token allocations, and transfers.                                      |
| **Token.sol**          | ERC-20 compliant token providing governance rights and protocol utility.                                       |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Development Guide

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16+)
- pnpm

### Local Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/softlaw.git
cd softlaw

# Install dependencies
pnpm install
```

### Development Workflow

1. Edit smart contracts in the root directory
2. Compile smart contracts:
   ```bash
   pnpm build
   ```
3. Deploy contracts:
   ```bash
   pnpm deploy-contracts
   ```
4. Export contract data:
   ```bash
   pnpm export
   ```

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file with the following variables:

```
ACCOUNT_SEED=your_seed_phrase_here
RPC_URL=https://westend-asset-hub-eth-rpc.polkadot.io
```

- `ACCOUNT_SEED`: Seed phrase for the account that will sign the deployment
- `RPC_URL`: RPC endpoint
  - For Westend Asset Hub: `https://westend-asset-hub-eth-rpc.polkadot.io`
  - For local development: `http://localhost:8545`
